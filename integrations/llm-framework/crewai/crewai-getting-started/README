# CrewAI Project Setup

This README provides instructions to set up your development environment for working with CrewAI and Langtrace.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a virtual environment named `crewenv`:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv crewenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - **macOS/Linux**:  
     ```bash
     source crewenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows**:  
     ```bash
     .\crewenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**  
   Once your virtual environment is activated, install the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install langtrace-python-sdk
   pip install crewai crewai-tools
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Create a .env File**  
   In the root directory of your project, create a `.env` file and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your OpenAI API Key>
   LANGTRACE_API_KEY=<Your Langtrace API Key>
   ```

5. **Obtain Langtrace API Key**  
   - Go to [Langtrace](https://langtrace.ai) and sign up or log in.
   - Create a new project for CrewAI.
   - Obtain your Langtrace API key and add it to your `.env` file.

6. **Run the Project**  
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python crewai_example/src/latest_ai_development/main.py
   ```
